#Make a monster
#Let user add health and damage up to the total of the max health + max damage an adventurer could have, minus 2

#make an adventurer with at least one health and one damage, but up to a random amount for each

#Loop:
#Add adventurers to list until the sum of the values of their equipment is more than the monster's sum
#Remove last adventurer

#Add monster to unit list, randomize the order of the list.

#On unit turn, send attack to server (as thread)
#On monster (player) turn, ask who to attack

#Loop player turn until attack is declared, allowing equiping within the loop

#When an adventurer is dead, add their loot to the hoard, sending the names one-by-one to the player

#When all adventurers dead, narrate a new day

#If monster dies, end game
